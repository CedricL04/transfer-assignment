# That Time I got reincarnated as a Git Commit in another world

## Chapter 1
In the final moments of an all-nighter, Ren collapsed at his desk, the glow of his terminal still flickering with life. He had just typed git commit -m "final fix" before the world went black. When he awoke, he wasn't in his cramped apartment anymore—he was floating in a dark void, surrounded by glowing commit hashes and cryptic merge conflicts drifting like stars. A booming voice echoed: "Welcome, Ren, to the Repository Realm. You are no longer a coder—you are the code."

## Chapter 2
Ren soon discovered that he had been reincarnated as a commit. Not metaphorically—his entire being was encapsulated in a single commit object, message and all. He floated through the branches of the Main Tree, haunted by rebases and hunted by rogue garbage collectors. Other commits, bearing ancient messages like "init" and "fix typo", spoke in hushed tones of the Merge War that fractured the Master Branch and gave rise to the Forked Lands. His own hash, 7e1fa3b, was whispered among the rebels: the chosen commit who might unify the scattered branches and bring stability to the network.

## Chapter 3
Determined to fulfill his role, Ren pushed forward—literally—into uncharted branches, facing corrupted blobs and rollback demons. His journey wasn’t just about survival; it was about discovering his purpose in this strange, decentralized world. With each cherry-pick of knowledge and each pull of destiny, he came closer to rewriting the fate of the Repository Realm. And maybe, just maybe, he'd find a way to merge back into the world he once called home.
